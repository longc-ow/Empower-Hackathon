# p5.js

This is the Template Repl for p5.js.

p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is free and open-source because we believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.

GENERAL PREMISE:
following the life of a fgli college student
will have choices a fgli student may have to encounter (~week)
Studying for your final vs working → 
Insurance vs student loans
Public transportation vs walking
GOALS:
provide insight into struggles fgli students face
and the effect of those issues on mental health
to show solidarity to those impacted and face similar struggles
provide mental health resources + support (at the end)

We chose to combine a collection style game with a more traditional and educational format. The game is supposed to represent the difficult decision’s fgli students get thrown at them day to day. We force our players to make difficult decisions that could impact their near future so they can understand a fraction of what real fgli students go through. We used the p5.play library to make this game.

This game is marketed towards young people in particular who may have friends who are first-generation and low income. We want our game to serve as a way for people to make a difference in other's lives or at least be aware of what others are going through.
